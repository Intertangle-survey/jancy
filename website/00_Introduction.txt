# Introducing Jancy

What?! Yet another programming language? Like, there isn't enough of them already? 

Believe us, we know how it sounds! We also likely know every possible argument against creating a new programming language. But the truth is, Jancy was <i>not</i> created just to fix the infamous <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/windows/a-brief-history-of-windows-programming-r/225701475" target="_blank">fatal flaw</a> of other languages -- although we admit that the passion to invent was a significant driving force.

<i>The main</i> motivation to create Jancy was our software product called [IO Ninja](/ioninja/). 

What we needed was a scripting language with safe data pointer arithmetic, extensive facilities for UI programming (properties, events, etc.), and easy integration with the host C/C++ application.

We couldn't find such a language! So we created it. Meet Jancy.

## Main design goals

* Object-oriented language for IO and UI programming with C-family syntax
* Designed to be used as a scripting language from the host C/C++ application
* ABI (application-binary-interface) compatibility with C/C++
* Automatic memory management via accurate GC (garbage collection)
* LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine) as a back-end

## Key features

* Safe pointers and pointer arithmetic
* Properties (the most comprehensive implementation thereof)
* Multicasts and events (including weak events, which do not require to unsubscribe)
* Reactive programming (one of the first implementations in a general-purpose imperative language)
* Exception-style syntax over error code checks
* Built-in regexp-based generator of incremental lexers/scanners

## Other notable features
* Multiple inheritance support
* Const-correctness support
* RAII (resource-acquisition-is-initialization) paradigm support
* Explicit stack allocation and thread-local storage
* Weak pointers (that do not retain objects)
* Partial application support for functions and properties
* Scheduled function pointers
* Bitflag enums
* Perl-style formatting 
* …and more
