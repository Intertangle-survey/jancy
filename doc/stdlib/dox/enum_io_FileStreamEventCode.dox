\enum io.FileStreamEventCode

	\import io_base.jncx
	\import io_FileStream.jnc

	\brief This enumeration contains codes of all possible events that might happen on `io.FileStream` object.

	When `io.FileStream` object is about to fire an event, it allocates an `io.FileStreamEventParams` structure, sets `io.FileStreamEventParams.m_eventCode` field to one of the values below, fills other relevant fields of and then calls all subscribers of `io.FileStream.m_onFileStreamEvent`.

	\sa `io.FileStream`, `io.FileStreamEventParams`

	\enumvalue Eof

		End-of-file was reached on the file stream.

	\enumvalue IncomingData

		More data is available on the file stream; this data could be fetched with `io.FileStream.read` method.

	\enumvalue IoError

		An IO error occured on the file stream; detailed information about the error is available at `io.FileStreamEventParams.m_error`.

	\enumvalue TransmitBufferReady

		File stream transmit buffer is ready to accept more data; it's OK to issue more `io.FileStream.write` requests.
