Building on Unix
================

Run in ``./build`` folder::

	make

You might also want to add ``-j <n>`` to make use of multiple CPU cores and speed up build process, like::

	make -j 4

After Jancy build is complete you will have Jancy static library files in ``./build/jancy/lib/${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}`` directory; command line compiler, dynamic extension libraries, and sample executable binaries can be found in ``./build/jancy/bin/${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}``.

Note that with ``make``-based build changing configuration from ``Debug`` to ``Release`` should be done at CMake configuration step (Xcode and Visual Studio are multi-configuration build systems).

Testing
-------

Now let's test compiled binaries.

Run in ``./build`` folder::

	make test

If everything went smooth, you should see something like::

	100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 123

Congratulations! You have just successfully built Jancy.
