Building on Windows
===================

To build Jancy on Windows you can start Visual Studio by double-clicking the newly generated solution file ``jancy_b.sln`` and build it from the IDE.

If you prefer building from command line, run in ``./build`` folder::

	cmake --build .

You can pass extra command-line arguments to ``msbuild.exe`` using ``--`` switch. For example, if you want to have a multi-core build of ``Release`` configuration, run::

	cmake --build . -- /maxcpucount /property:configuration=Release

Please refer to ``msbuild`` documentation for more details on command-line parameters: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms164311.aspx

After Jancy build is complete you will have Jancy static library files in ``./build/lib/$(Configuration)`` directory; command line compiler, dynamic extension libraries and sample executable binaries can be found in ``./build/bin/$(Configuration)``.


Testing
-------

Now let's test compiled binaries.

If you used Visual Studio IDE to build Jancy, you can run tests from inside the IDE. To do so, right click on ``RUN_TESTS`` pseudo-project in Visual Studio Solution Explorer/Navigator and select ``Build``.

If you prefer using command line, then run in ``./build`` folder::

	ctest -C Debug
	ctest -C Release

Another way to run tests on Windows is::

	cmake --build . --target RUN_TESTS --config Debug
	cmake --build . --target RUN_TESTS --config Release

Obviously, you can only test ``Debug`` or ``Release`` configuration if you have already built this configuration.

If everything went smooth, you should see something like::

	100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 123

Congratulations! You have just successfully built Jancy.
