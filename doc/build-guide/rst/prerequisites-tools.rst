Tools
=====

Jancy build system relies on its own path configuration so you do not actually need to add any of these tools to ``PATH``. However, it is resommended to make CMake easily available (e.g. via ``PATH`` or a shortcut to ``cmake-gui``) -- because it is used to initiate the whole build process.

Required Tools
--------------

These tools are **required** for building the Jancy compiler:

* CMake 3.3 or above

	Jancy uses CMake-based build system. CMake is a cross-platform C/C++-centric build system which works by converting build scripts into platform-dependent makefiles. CMake is quickly becoming a de-facto standard when it comes to building cross-platform C/C++ applications.

	CMake is available in official repositories of most Linux distributions. Source and pre-compiled binaries can also be directly downloaded from the official website: http://cmake.org

	Any version of CMake above 3.3 should work. Versions prior to CMake 3.3 improperly expand ``CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE`` variable which Jancy build system relies on.

* Ragel

	Jancy uses Ragel as a lexer/scanner generator for the tokenization stage of its front-end. Ragel is a cross-platform finite state machine compiler. I found Ragel to be perfect for lexer/scanner generation due to the convenience of its input language and great performance of the output code.

	Ragel is available in official repositories of most Linux distributions. Sources can be downloaded from the official website: http://www.colm.net/open-source/ragel

	Unfortunately, the official website does not distribute pre-compiled binaries anymore, so you have to either build Ragel yourself or choose one of the unofficial pre-compiled binaries available on the web.

* Perl

	Jancy uses Perl to convert Jancy source files containing definitions of standard types and functions into C++ code snippets, which are then included in Jancy compiler C++ source files.

	Perl is available out-of-the-box in most Linux distributions and Mac OS X. On Windows you can use ActivePerl (http://www.activestate.com/activeperl) or StraberryPerl (http://strawberryperl.com).

	Both work just fine for the purposes of executing Jancy build-time scripts.

* 7-Zip

	Jancy uses 7-Zip file archiver to package dynamic extensions.

	7-Zip is available in official repositories of many Linux distributions as ``p7zip``. For Mac OS X you can either use Homebrew (http://brew.sh) to install ``p7zip`` or download an unofficial pre-compiled binary (such as ``7zx``). Pre-compiled binaries for Windows are available at the official website: http://www.7-zip.org

.. _optional-tools:

Optional Tools
--------------

These tools are **optional** and only needed if you plan to build Jancy documentation:

* Python

	Jancy documentation uses Sphinx as a back-end, therefore, Python is also needed.

	Python is available out-of-the-box in most Linux distributions and Mac OS X. On Window you can install the official binaries available at: https://www.python.org
	or use ActivePython: http://www.activestate.com/activepython

	Both 3.5.x and 2.7.x branches should be fine (Sphinx documentation states that the required version is at least 2.6).

* Doxygen

	Jancy documentation uses Doxygen to analyze API headers, extract declarations and comments and build XML database.

	Doxygen is available in official repositories of most Linux distributions. Source and pre-compiled binaries can also be directly downloaded from the official website: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/

* Doxyrest

	Jancy documentation uses Doxyrest as a middle-end in ``doxygen-doxyrest-sphinx`` or ``jancy-doxyrest-sphinx`` pipelines. Doxyrest is a tool based on Lua string templates; it's purpose is to convert from Doxygen-style XML database to Re-Structured Text.

	Doxyrest must be built from sources available at: http://tibbo.com/downloads/archive/doxyrest

* Sphinx

	Jancy documentation uses Sphinx as a back-end for generating HTML or PDF output.

	Sphinx is available via ``pip`` Python package management infrastructure. It should also be available in many Linux distributions as a stand-alone binary package.

	The official website of Sphinx: http://www.sphinx-doc.org
