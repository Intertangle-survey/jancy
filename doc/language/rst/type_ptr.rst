Pointer Types
=============

Unsafe as they are, pointers are not something we can live without. Even languages without pointers (like Basic or Java) have pointers to classes and interfaces.

Pointers has always been considered an unsafe tool that could easily cause a program to crash or (worse!) silently corrupt user data.

Even if we limit the number of pointer kinds and pointer operations available to developers, we still won't be able to perform the complete analysis of pointer-related correctness at compile time.

For the purpose of the discussion that follows let's define **pointer safety**.

We will call a pointer **safe** if it's impossible to either crash a program or corrupt user data by accessing this pointer. This means that any invalid pointer access will be caught and handled by the language runtime.
